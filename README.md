# RC-Rover-Project
This is a repository for my personal RC Rover Project. I am converting a Traxxas Bandit VXL 
into a fully self-driving rover and am planning on also making the arm fully autonomous.


# TODO
[X] Test new Smart Dashboard
[X] Test drive motor (Scary! | Motor go burr)
[X] Clean up repository (big mess)

# Finished Items
[✅] introduce functionality to the triggers for the controller
[✅] decide on how to stream the packet to the Arduino (Sent through network from LT to ESP32)
    (Potentially through SERIAL via network connection?!)
[✅] initialize first test (Working steer servo with rc control)
