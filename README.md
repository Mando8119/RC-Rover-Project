# RC-Rover-Project

This is a repository for my personal RC Rover Project. I am converting a Traxxas Bandit VXL into a fully self-driving rover and planning to make the arm fully autonomous.

## Project Items
- Traxxas Bandit VXL
- Arduino Nano ESP32
- Laptop with capabilities to run Python and Arduino (C++) Code

## TODO
- [X] Test drive motor (Scary! | Motor go burr)
- [X] Figure out how to power both the ESP32 and Drive_Servo
- [X] Source Servos for the project

## Finished Tasks
- [✅] Introduce functionality to the triggers for the controller
- [✅] Decide on how to stream the packet to the Arduino (Sent through network from LT to ESP32) (Potentially through SERIAL via network connection?!)
- [✅] Initialize first test (Working steer servo with rc control)
- [✅] Clean up repository (big mess)
- [✅] Test new Smart Dashboard
