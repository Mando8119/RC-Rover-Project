# RC-Rover-Project
This is a repository for my personal RC Rover Project. I am converting a Traxxas Bandit VXL 
into a fully self-driving rover and am planning on also making the arm fully autonomous.


# TODO
[âœ…] introduce functionality to the triggers for the controller
[x] decide on how to stream packet to the arduino 
    (Potentially through SERIAL via network connection?!)
[x] initialize first test
